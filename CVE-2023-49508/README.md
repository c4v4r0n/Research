# CVE-2023-49508: Path traversal allow authenticated users to read .txt files YetiForceCRM
modules/Settings/Dependencies/views/LibraryLicense.php until version 6.4.0 does not sanitize the license parameter allowing attackers to use ../../../ inside the parameter value. 
But the file also append '.txt' at the end of the string before reading the file, this limits the attack to only .txt files
